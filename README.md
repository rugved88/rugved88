## Featured Projects

### 1. [Fast-Processing Bi-Modal Large Language (LLM) and Vision Model](https://github.com/rugved88/Bi-Modalities-Large-Language-Model-Text-Image-)
**Challenge:** Enhancing AI's multimodal processing abilities, focusing on text and image modalities.  
**Objective Achieved:** Developed a bi-modal model using CLIP, GPT-3 LLM, and custom synchronization algorithm for content generation across text and image modalities, improving content quality and inference time.

### 2. [Graph-Based Optimization for Controlling and Monitoring Multiple Delivery Robots via External Camera](https://github.com/rugved88/Robot-tracking-via-central-monitoring-system)
**Challenge:** Efficiently controlling and monitoring delivery robots to minimize delivery time and cost.  
**Objective Achieved:** Implemented a hybrid BFS algorithm in robots for optimal pathfinding, utilized TCP for real-time instruction transmission, and employed computer vision for grid detection.

### 3. [Dynamic Display Adjustments: Using Real-time User Positioning and Eye Monitoring for Optimal Screen Settings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bUi90hpe7w)
**Challenge:** The primary challenge addressed in this research is the static nature of laptop display settings, which fail to adapt to varying user proximity, position, and application requirements. This oversight in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) leads to suboptimal user experiences and can potentially affect ocular well-being.  
**Objective Achieved:** 
1. Dynamic Adaptation: Utilize the laptop's camera for real-time adjustment of display settings based on user distance and orientation, enhancing user experience.
2. Ocular Health Focus: Monitor visual strain symptoms to adjust screen settings, such as blue light filtration, for improved eye comfort and well-being.
3. Automated User-Centric Modes: Implement template-based configurations like "Research Mode" for optimized and personalized digital workspace setup.

### 4. [Plant Health Monitoring System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZWT_qV5Bj4)
**Challenge:** Real-time monitoring and adjustment of environmental conditions for optimal plant health.  
**Objective Achieved:** Created a system to monitor soil moisture and light intensity, adjusting levels as needed for plant health, with remote access to data.

### 5. [Restaurant Management System](#)
**Challenge:** Create a Relational Data Base Management Project using SQL and NodeJS  
**Objective Achieved:** This system is a comprehensive solution for managing restaurant operations, including tracking customer names, bills, transaction times, and food item availability. Designed for installation at restaurant counters, it features a user-friendly web interface. The system provides valuable analytics, such as identifying the highest selling food items and summarizing daily and monthly revenue. To handle the vast amount of data generated, we employ big data storage techniques. Additionally, we leverage TensorFlow.js for machine learning algorithms to forecast future sales trends, like predicting the next day's or month's revenue. This approach enhances operational efficiency and decision-making for restaurant owners.

### 6. [Multi-Featured Home and Work Automation Robot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaQxsuHskcA)
**Objective Achieved:** In this project, we developed a sophisticated smart home automation system that combines computer vision for owner detection, voice assistance, and environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, smoke) with smart notifications. The system enables control of smart home devices like lights and fans through a user-friendly interface. Leveraging the Robot Operating System (ROS) for intelligent room mapping and multi-robot coordination, it also includes a DIY 4WD face-tracking robot powered by Raspberry Pi, OpenCV, and Fusion 360. This integrated approach results in a secure, efficient, and interactive smart home experience.
